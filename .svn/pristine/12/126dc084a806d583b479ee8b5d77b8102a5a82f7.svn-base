== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it inject JavaScript? =

If you choose 'Native only' (from settings), no JavaScript will be injected. Otherwise it injects a JS code of 0.8KB  (0.3KB gzipped).

= How's it different from other lazy loading plugins? =

Most of the lazy loading plugins rely on JavaScript lazy loading, which injects a few KBs of JS. Nazy Load using browser's native lazy loading. Optionally use JavaScript if browser is not supported.
