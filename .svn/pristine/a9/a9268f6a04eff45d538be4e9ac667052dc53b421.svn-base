## Features

- **Free Unlimited CDN** - Flying Images uses [Statically](https://statically.io/) to provide free CDN. Statically is powered by Cloudflare (premium network), BunnyCDN, Fastly and CDN77. No hidden charges or upsell.
- **On the fly Image Compression** - Compress images on the fly via CDN. You can also set the desired quality needed.
- **On the fly WebP conversion** - Convert and deliver images as Webp via CDN if the browser supports it.
- **Responsive/Adaptive Images** - Creates srcset to deliver resized images based on device. Supports external images too.
- **Native/JavaScript lazy loading** – Load images using the browser's native lazy loading if available (currently supported in Chrome) or via JavaScript. JavaScript only lazy load is also available. Also supports lazy loading inlined background images.
- **Tiny JavaScript** – Only 0.7KB, gzipped, minified.
- **Rewrites entire HTML** – Never miss an image from lazy loading or adding CDN, even the ones injected by gallery plugins.
